## What is Git
- A version control system that saves a snapshot of your project every time you make changes
- Each change has to be documented with a description of the changes
- If multiple people are working on the same project (or if one person works on it in multiple places), changes can be synced
- Syncing requires storing the project on a Git server (eg, [GitHub](https://github.com/))
- Since code is stored online, it's easy to share with others
- GitHub is a free service, but requires that all code to be publicly available
    - this isn't normally a problem for biologists, though you may want to ensure that your **data** are not included in the repository

![XKCD Branching Model](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

## Setup 

- Installing RStudio
    - Available from https://www.rstudio.com
    - Appears to require EUR to install

- Installing GitHub Desktop
    - Available from https://desktop.github.com
    - For some reason, this seems to install with no difficulty
    - Create GitHub account and log into GitHub Desktop using these credentials
    - In theory, it is possible to run Git directly through RStudio, but:
        A) You would have to learn a new interface to use Git for any other project
        B) I can't get it to work with the networked drive

- Cloning [LearningMLwiN](https://github.com/MixedModels/LearningMLwinN)
    - Click on + in upper left corner of GitHub Desktop, then "Clone"
    - Select MixedModels/LearningMLwinN from the menu (if it doesn't show up, ask me to add you to MixedModels)
    - Select destination folder
    - Open RStudio, click on project selector in upper right corner, and select "New Project"
    - Click on "Existing Directory" and navigate to cloned repository, then click "select folder" and "Create Project"

- Adding an Existing Project
    - Click on project selector in upper right corner of RStudio and select "New Project"
    - Click on "Existing Directory" and navigate to folder, then click "Select Folder" and "Create Project"
    - Click on + in upper left corner of GitHub Desktop, then "Create"
    - Navigate to folder and click OK
    - Give repository a name and create (note that redundant names in different locations on your file system will clash on the server)
    
- Starting from Scratch
    - Click on project selector in upper right corner of RStudio and select "New Project"
    - Click on "New Directory", then "Empty Project", then pick a project name and location
    - Click on + in upper left corner of GitHub Desktop, then "Create"
    - Navigate to folder and click OK
    - Give repository a name and create
   
## Working with RStudio
- Collects all of the files associated with a project together
- Snippets of code from a script can be run on their own, or code can be entered directly into the console
- Nice GUIs for viewing and saving plots, importing data-sets, and viewing data-frames
- Work-spaces are automatically saved for each project
- I have not figured out an easy way to work on scripts that accept command line arguments

## R Markdown
- Used to prepare this document
- Simple plain text [syntax](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) used to format document (this syntax is also used many other places, including GitHub)
- Code and output can be embedded:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lme4) #glmer
library(readr)
SchoolData<-read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MixedModels/LearningMLwinN/master/tutorial.txt")
SchoolData$school<-factor(SchoolData$school)
SchoolData$girl<-factor(SchoolData$girl)
MOD.1 <- lmer(normexam ~ standlrt + (1|school), data = SchoolData, REML=F)
summary(MOD.1)

```
Try git demo
- Plots can also be embedded without displaying the code:
    
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
augment(MOD.1) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(standlrt, .fitted)) +
  geom_line(aes(group =school), colour="blue") +
  geom_point(aes(y=normexam), shape=17, colour="blue", size=3, data = SchoolData) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-2.4, 1.8, .6)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-24, 32, 8)/10)

```

- Reports can be converted to html, pdf, ms word, etc using the "Knit" drop-down menu
- A workflow that I have found to be useful is to experiment with analyses using R Markdown (which can be easily shared with collaborators and mentors), then to prepare R scripts that generate all of the final analyses included in the paper

## Working with GitHub Desktop

- To make changes to the repo:
    - Click on "Changes" at top of window
    - Select files to add
    - Write summary of changes and (optional) description
    - Click "commit to master"
- To revert changes:
    - Click on "History" at top of window
    - Navigate through commits to find the offending edit (deletions are marked red, additions are green)
    - Click on "Revert"
- To sync local copy to remote server:
    - Click "Sync"

- To resolve conflicts:
    - If sync fails because changes on remote server can't be automatically merged with local changes, open file in RStudio and edit conflicts manually
    - Conflicts look like this:
    
    - ```
<<<<<<<<<<<< HEAD
local version of code
=============
remote version
>>>>>>>>>>>> origin/master
```  
    - Edit file to include whatever parts from the local and remote versions you please (and remove markers added by Git)
    - Return to GitHub Desktop, commit changes, and redo sync
    - If all else fails, save local files in another location, delete the project, clone fresh copy from server, then add back in your local changes
    
- Working with branches:
    - I generally don't bother creating additional branches beyond the local and remote master versions
    - I mostly mention it because it is a central feature of git and there is a prominant widget for it in GitHub Desktop
    - If multiple people are working on the same project, it's nice if they can work on the same files independently without having to merge everything together each time they make a commit
    - This can acomplished by creating seperate branches for each person, then merging everything together once everyone has completed their part of the project
    - Create a new branch by clicking on the "Create new branch" is in the upper left, next to the "master" dropdown menu
    - Give your branch a name and click OK
    - Any changes made in RStudio will now be confined to your new branch
    - The "Sync" button will now be replaced by a "Publish" button because there is no copy of your new branch on the server to sync to
    - After clicking on "Publish", the "Sync" button will come back and any changes made to your files will not conflict with changes on the master version on the server
    - You can now use the drop down menu in the upper left to switch between brances, which will automatically change the code in RStudio
    - When you are ready to merge branches back together, you need to make a Pull request, then go to the online version and confirm the request
    - There is a Pull request button in GitHub Desktop, but it's probably easier to do it all online
    - If there are conflicts, they can be resolved as above
    
## A few additional considerations
- Bookmarking snapshots (example: the version used for the analyses in a paper submission)
    - Make zipped copy of directory
    - Make a note the number of the last commit before submission (eg; ce289b3)
    - Create a separate branch for each submission
    - Tag commit
        - Go online and click on the "0 releases" button beneath the project description
        - Click on "Create a new release"
        - Give release a name (unfortunately only names like "v1.0" are supported)
        - Click on "This is a pre-release" if it's not the final version of the paper, then on "Publish release"
        - This will automatically create a ziped version of all the code that can be navigated to by clicking on the "1 release" button for the project
- Excluding private files
    - When you initialise a repo, a .gitignore file will automatically be created with a list of files that will never be synced to the server
    - Files on the list will not show up on the lists of modified files to add to a commit
    - It's a good idea to list any data files that you don't want to make public in this file, along with any config files that contain things like login credentials
    - Of course, any files that are not part of the repo will need to be synced some other way

- README, LICENSE
    - When a repo is created online, you have the option of creating a README.md file that is displayed automatically on the landing page for your project
    - If you are creating a repo locally, you'd need to do this manually with RStudio (or other text editor)
    - You are also given the option of adding a license to the repo, though the available options are tailored to software (I would suggest using the Creative Commons [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/uk/legalcode) license for most biology projects)

## Beyond R
- Using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) directly to format Markdown files
    - Reports, letters, manuscripts
    - Requires a some knowledge of LaTeX for any advanced formatting
    - This command:
    
```
pandoc -r markdown  -s -S --latex-engine=pdflatex --template=letter.template -o letter.pdf letter.md 
```
can convert this:
    
```

**RE: Manuscript submission.**

I write to ask you to consider for publication in your august journal our attached manuscript entitled: “Genome editing and precision medicine: a systems biology approach” by Heath O'Brien and co-authors.

In this landmark study will revolutionize our understanding of medicine and something about CRISPR. You would be a fool to pass up an opportunity to publish it.

When you do send decide to send it to reviewers, I suggest the following junior colleagues who would be too intimidated to criticize it, even anonymously: [...]

Thank you for your consideration.

- Meta-notebooks
    - Notes can be organised in a logical order, without interleaving unrelated work that was done on the same day
    - Commit history preserves a chronological record
    - Additional explanation, comments, etc can be recorded in commit message without cluttering notes
    - If you're fortunate enough to have lab mentors, they can easily review your notes and leave comments
    - If using the free version of GitHub, you may need to be a bit coy about exactly what you are working on to prevent your competetors from stealing you work
- Using Git for manuscript writing
    - Can be used to avoid this:
    - ![tweet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MixedModels/LearningMLwinN/master/ScreenShots/tweet.png)
    - Merging changes by different co-authors is done automatically
    - Keeps a record of all changes, who made them, and why
    - Discussions about particular changes can be had in the comment thread for that change instead of in email threads
    - Issue tracker can be used as a to-do list, and also includes comment threads for discussion of proposed tasks
    - Branching can be used to allow a co-author to make a series of commits that can all be merged at once
    - This may well be something you'd want a private repo for. Private GitHub accounts are £5 per month, but appear to be available for free to educational institutions
